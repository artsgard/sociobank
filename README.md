# sociobank
A Springboot REST Bank Account Application for Socios

1) General Info About the Socio-Micro-Service-Demo

2) Specific Info Concerning Each Single Application



## General Info ====

The Socio Micro Services Project will consist of about 10 small (backend) Springboot applications, deployed in a Docker Container/ Linux Oracle Virtual Box. SocioRegister is the principal part of a series of four applications called: starter, mock, jpa, socioregister. Together they show a stepwise buildup to a Springboot REST application, which contains use-cases for registering and adding Socios (similar to Facebook). This line of applications goes from an almost empty Springboot shell (starter: one controller method only) to a small but full-fledged REST application: SocioRegister which will be used as a component of our micro-services.

Next you`ll find four other serving applications. The simple SocioWeather, provides a weather-report by city by consulting an external REST-service called Open Weather. SocioBank, permits money transaction between Socios, also consulting an external service for exchange rates. The SocioSecurity, a Cookie/ Token based SpringSecurity (OAUTH2), still has to be written. Finally the SocioDbBatch application is interesting because it will update, on a daily bases, the databases of SocioRegister (socio_db) and SocioBank (soicio_bank_db). The DBs run on MySQL or Postgres.

From SocioRegister-jpa one finds backend-Validation (javax) and REST-Exception Handeling of Spring (RestControllerAdvice).

Testing, in general, will have an important focus and since we are dealing with Spring(boot) there will systematically testing based on five mayor strategies:

	-@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)

	-@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) standalone setup (two ways)

	-@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) server tests (@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)

	-@DataJpaTest wich is database testing on H2

	-Spring Batch testing

Testing is still "work in progress"



## Specific Info SocioBank ====

SocioBank permits banking amung socios. The application contains a small Spring-Batch and a web-REST-banking-application. The batch part initializes some bankaccount data and invokes some banking transactions. The banking part has a few use-cases to create/ update/ delete accounts and to perform some transactions of accounts with different currencies. An external exchange service will provide the api with the current exchange course.
